//! Escrow funding flow: accept a bid and lock investor funds in escrow.
//!
//! Called from the public API with a reentrancy guard. Validates invoice/bid state,
//! creates escrow via payments, and updates bid, invoice, and investment state.
//!
//! ## One-Escrow-Per-Invoice Invariant
//! Each invoice may have **at most one** escrow record across its entire lifetime.
//! This is enforced at two independent layers:
//!
//! 1. **`load_accept_bid_context`** - checks `EscrowStorage::get_escrow_by_invoice`
//!    and `InvestmentStorage::get_investment_by_invoice` before any state changes.
//! 2. **`payments::create_escrow`** - re-checks `get_escrow_by_invoice` before the
//!    token transfer, so the guard holds even if the higher-level check is bypassed.
//!
//! Any duplicate attempt returns [`QuickLendXError::InvoiceAlreadyFunded`] or
//! [`QuickLendXError::InvalidStatus`] and leaves all state unchanged.
//! See `test_escrow_uniqueness.rs` for the full attack-vector test suite.
